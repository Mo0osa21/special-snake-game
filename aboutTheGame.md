# Snake Game

#### The Snake Game is a nostalgic recreation of the classic arcade game. In this game, players control a snake that grows longer by eating apples while avoiding obstacles and colliding with itself. The goal is to score as many points as possible while navigating through increasingly challenging levels.

#### I chose this game because of its simplicity and the challenge of implementing smooth movement, collision detection, and dynamic gameplay. It was a great project to develop my coding skills and learn game logic.
